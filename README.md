# Canvas 3D Camera

## Live Demo

See [this webpage](https://wwwaldo.github.io).

## Building

This section concerns building the demo from your local machine.

1. Install parcelJS using your favourite package manager. I used `npm`.

See install instructions [here](https://parceljs.org/).

I had parcel 1.11.0 on my local machine at the time of install.

2. Clone the repo.

3. From the repo directory, build using `parcel index.html`. Assuming parcel works, you should see a dev server with the camera demo.

## About

This demo renders the vertices of a dodecahedron onto a 2D canvas as a point cloud.

The camera viewing the dodecahedron can be rotated. Rotations are implemented with quaternions.

The quaternion implementation was hacked together from an explanation of quaternion algebra done by Grant Sanderson (3b1b) and Ben Eater. You can find out more [here](https://eater.net/quaternions).

I used TypeScript because debugging is easier in type-checked languages.

## Appendix: Building for 'production'

This section describes how to stick the demo on your server.

Add the flag

`--public-url ./`

to `parcel build index.html`

and copy the `dist` folder to your server directory. See my confused [StackExchange question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54048932/how-do-i-deploy-my-web-app-built-with-parceljs-on-my-ubuntu-18-10-server).
